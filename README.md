# Fillit

Another project at 42. In this one, we need to parse one **and only one** file, that is given in parameter to the executable, and retrieve a list of well formated __tetriminos__¹. Depending on this list, the next step is to print on the standard output the first __smallest square__² found in which all pieces can fit correctly.

__tetriminos__¹ : Tetriminos are defined by a combination of four connected points or cells.
__smallest square__² : The smallest square is the first solution found by the program. A correct solution is a result in which all pieces are placed the highest  and at the left most position.
