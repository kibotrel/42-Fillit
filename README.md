# Fillit

Another project at 42. In this one, we need to parse one **and only one** file, that is given in parameter to the executable, and retrieve a list of well formated tetriminos¹. Depending on this list, the next step is to print on the standard output the first smallest square² found in which all pieces can fit correctly.
