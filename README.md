# Fillit

Another project at 42. In this one, we need to parse one **and only one** file, that is given in parameter to the executable, and retrieve a list of well formated *tetriminos*¹. Depending on this list, the next step is to print on the standard output the first *smallest square*² found in which all pieces can fit correctly.

Here's an example : 
Consider we're using this file as argument of our program

This project was done in collaboration with [@abaurens](https://github.com/abaurens)

*tetriminos*¹ : Tetriminos are defined by a combination of four connected points or cells.

*smallest square*² : The smallest square is the first solution found by the program. A correct solution is a result in which all pieces are placed the highest  and at the left most position.
